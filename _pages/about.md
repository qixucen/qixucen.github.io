<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Helloüëã, here is a person who stumbled into the field of AI by accident and still hasn't left. He graduated from the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence at Renmin University of China with a bachelor's degree.

He is passionate about hackathons and has secured significant prizes in various competitions organized by prominent Chinese internet companies. His motto is to venture forth like bounty hunters!

His research interests primarily focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly Large Language Model (LLM)-based Agents and LLM Reasoning. Recently, his work has centered on agentic workflow optimization and the development of reasoning frameworks leveraging inference-time scaling techniques. His research in this area began during his internship at [Kwai](https://www.kuaishou.com/), where he gained hands-on experience in exploring and advancing these technologies.

**[ICLR 2025 Oral (1.8%)]** AFlow: Automating Agentic Workflow Generation \[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10762)\]\[[code](https://github.com/didiforgithub/MetaGPT-MathAI/tree/main/examples/ags)\]\[[report](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5YpPFYIpuCkSf0sJp0_RnQ)\]

We introduces AFlow, an automated framework that reformulates workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, using Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently explore and refine workflows through code modification and execution feedback. By leveraging this approach, AFlow achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, while also enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones at a fraction of the cost.

**[ARXIV]** Atom of Thoughts for Markov LLM Test-Time Scaling \[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12018)\]

We introduce Atom of Thoughts (AoT), a novel reasoning framework that transforms complex reasoning processes into a Markov-style sequence of atomic questions. By implementing a two-phase transition mechanism of decomposition and contraction, AoT eliminates the need to maintain historical dependencies during reasoning, allowing models to focus computational resources on the current question state. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate AoT's effectiveness both as a standalone framework and as a plug-in enhancement for existing test-time scaling methods.

# üíª Internships
- *2023.09 - 2024.01* <img src="images/kuaishou.png" alt="" style="width: auto; height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;">Kwai Technology
  - Research Focus: LLM-based Agents; Advanced Data Analysis
  - Main Contributions:
    - Define the code for data analysis and visualization as a finite automaton process, by learning transfer equations as tools from successful trajectories, defining a correct trajectory through a finite number of ordered calls to functions in the transfer equation library.
    - To address the challenge of white boxing, use retrieval-augmentation methods to provide a visual explanation process for each tool calling, enhancing users‚Äô confidence in the results provided by the AI copilot.
- *2023.05 - 2023.07* <img src="https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20230424/v2_06078b14341f4486835b4b05ec8d8fb4@000000_oswg7548oswg132oswg132_img_000" style="width: auto; height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;">Deep Space Symphony
  - Research Focus: Music-Driven Motion Diffusion; Controllable Generation
  - Main Contributions:
    - Combine VQVAE and Diffusion: independently train VQVAE on motion sequences to obtain discrete code book of keyframe, add music features in the attention during the diffusion phase, then obtain the prior of VQVAE in the encoder stage, and restore it to a music-driven motion sequence in the decoder stage.
    - Utilize choreography knowledge for fine-grained generation: edit discrete codes on time series and constrain discrete codes according to beats; perform lyrics-music separation for music with lyrics and repeat actions according to the lyrics.
