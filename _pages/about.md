<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Helloüëã, here is a person who stumbled into  the field of AI by accident and still hasn't left. He graduated from the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence at Renmin University of China with a bachelor's degree.

He is passionate about hackathons and has secured significant prizes in various competitions organized by prominent Chinese internet companies. Nowadays, he is more involved as a hackathon organizer.

His research interests lie primarily in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on LLM test-time scaling through approaches including reasoning frameworks, reasoning models (e.g., o1 and R1), and agentic workflow optimization.

He is still seeking PhD opportunities. It's a long journey, but he never lacks the perseverance to grow through adversity.

We introduces AFlow, an automated framework that reformulates workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, using Monte Carlo Tree Search to efficiently explore and refine workflows through code modification and execution feedback. By leveraging this approach, AFlow achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, while also enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones at a fraction of the cost.

We introduce Atom of Thoughts (AoT), a novel reasoning framework that transforms complex reasoning processes into a Markov-style sequence of atomic questions. By implementing a two-phase transition mechanism of decomposition and contraction, AoT eliminates the need to maintain historical dependencies during reasoning, allowing models to focus computational resources on the current question state. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate AoT's effectiveness both as a standalone framework and as a plug-in enhancement for existing test-time scaling methods.
